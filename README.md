# Tux Keychain
Keychain shaped like Tux, the Linux mascot. But it's not just a keychain, it runs embedded Linux!

Unfortunately this is more expensive than usual due to tariffs and inflation. (Probably cheaper in other countries.)

NOTE: This is still in the prototype stage, changes to the design are likely. It doesn't even look like Tux yet!

## Manufacturing
- This is a 4-layer PCB so it can fit in the Tux keychain form factor.
- Make sure you use ENIG for the PCB finish, else Tux will be gray instead of gold. (If you want a gray Tux, seek help.)
- This is designed for JLCPCBs assembly service, some parts are LCSC exclusive*.

*You can probably find them on other chinese distributors, but I don't know which ones.

The Allwinner F1C100s footprint/symbol is from https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/3340_kicad (F1C100s symbol, QFN-88_EP_10x10_Pitch0.4mm footprint).
Same for the JW5211 symbol and footprint.

Schematic heavily based on the business card design by thirtythreeforty (https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard.pdf).
